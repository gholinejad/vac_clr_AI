Vacuum Cleaner in AI World

I decided to provide a code in python language to show how a vacuum cleaner can clean an environment by random local search algorithms.
That very simple instance simulated and it needs a performance measurement to determine its efficiency.


### PEAS

In the following, i will examine the PEAS(Performance,Environment,Actuators,Sensors) elements for Agent Function:

* Performance : The cost of the search path should be reduced, so the performance measurement is that "cleaned pieces number per number of visited pieces"
* Environment : two dimentional env. with variable size.
* Actuators : 'right' 'left' 'up' 'down' --- 'suck' 'nop'
* Sensors : Determine whether pieces are clean or dirty





Finally, the result is as follows:
